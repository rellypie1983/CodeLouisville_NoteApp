Simple notes taking application (with a fun JAWS/JAWS 19 theme) using MEAN stack(MongoDB, Express.js, Angular.js and Node.js).


To run the app you need to have MongoDB, Node.js and (optional) nodemon installed.

Getting started:
  1. git clone the repo address 
  2. run npm install
  3. run node/nodemon server.js
  4. run mongod (in a separate shell)
  5. access app running on port 8080
  
  
  --Although this was a very simple project simply to demonstrate that I could use the MEAN stack and a working knowledge of CSS, there are several elements I would have liked to refine and improve and will hopefully have the knowledge and ability soon.
